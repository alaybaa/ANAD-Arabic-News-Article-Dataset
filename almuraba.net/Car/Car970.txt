 to fill the gapAfter months of speculation, Daimler has reportedly decided to phase out Maybach.[img]http://www.almuraba.net/filemanager.php?action=image&id=1373[/img]Citing high-ranking sources, Autocar is reporting Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche will axe the brand in order to focus more attention on Mercedes. As one insider commented, "We’ve come to the conclusion that it is better to cut our losses with Maybach than to continue into an uncertain future with a brand that has failed to live up to original sales expectations."If everything pans out, the last Maybachs will be built in early 2013. To fill the gap, Mercedes will reportedly offer a new S600 Pullman.
